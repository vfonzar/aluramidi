## 📖 About the Project

AluraMidi is a project developed during JavaScript studies, focused on DOM manipulation, keyboard and mouse events, and programming logic to simulate a musical keyboard in the browser.

In this project, we expanded the original content proposed by Alura by creating automated unit tests using Jest, setting up Babel for ESModules support, and modularizing JavaScript functions.

## ✔️ Techniques and Technologies Used

- `HTML` and `CSS`: Page structure and visual styling of buttons, responsive layout using Flexbox.
- `JavaScript (ES6+)`: DOM manipulation, keyboard and mouse events, modularization with `import/export`.
- `Jest`: Unit testing with DOM simulation (via jsdom).
- `Babel`: Transpiler to ensure Jest compatibility with ESModules.
